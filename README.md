# VR_Robotics_Class
This repo follows the UofL Graduate Special Topics course "Immersive Robotics; AR-VR", taught in Spring 2026.

This course develops skills (from 0) in Unity and Python towards building VR worlds with the Meta Quest 3s, and using it to teleoperate simulated/real robotic arms. The target robotic hardware platform for this course is Nick's TinyArm robot.
